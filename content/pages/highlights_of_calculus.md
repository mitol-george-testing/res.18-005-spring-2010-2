These five Highlights of Calculus videos provide an overview of the key topics and ideas of calculus and how they apply to real-life situations and problems. In addition to the videos, there are summary slides and practice problems complete with an audio narration by Professor Strang. You can find these files under the Related Resources tab on each video page.{{< video-gallery-item href="/resources/big-picture-of-calculus" section="Highlights of Calculus (5 videos)" title="Big Picture of Calculus" description="Calculus is about change. One function tells how quickly another  function is changing. Professor Strang shows how calculus applies to  ordinary life situations, such as: driving a car climbing a mountain growing to full adult height Professor Strangs Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available here.

Professor Strang is finding the rate of change and the slope of a  curve and the derivative of a function. Professor Strangs Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available here.

The  second derivative shows whether the curve is bending down or up. Here  is a real-world example of a minimum problem: What route from home to work takes the shortest time?

The graph of y = e x has the special property that its slope equals its  height (it goes up exponentially fast!). This is the great function of  calculus.

Finding this integral is the opposite of  finding the derivative. Professor Strang explains how the integral adds  up little pieces to recover the total distance. I know the speed at each moment of my trip, so how far did I go? Professor Strangs Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available here.
