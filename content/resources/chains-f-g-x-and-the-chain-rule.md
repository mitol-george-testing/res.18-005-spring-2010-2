A chain of functions starts with y = g(x)   Then it finds z = f(y).  So z = f(g(x))  
Very many functions are built this way, g inside f .   So we need their slopes.  
  
The Chain Rule says :  MULTIPLY THE SLOPES  of  f and g.  
  
Find dy/dx for g(x).   Then find dz/dy for f(y).   
Since dz/dy is found in terms of y, substitute g(x) in place of y !!!  
The way to remember the slope of the chain is dz/dx = dz/dy times dy/dx.   
Remove y to get a  function of x !   The slope of z = sin (3x) is 3 cos (3x).
