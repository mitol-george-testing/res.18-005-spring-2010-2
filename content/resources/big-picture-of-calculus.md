Calculus is about change. One function tells how quickly another function is changing. Professor Strang shows how calculus applies to ordinary life situations, such as:

*   driving a car
*   climbing a mountain
*   growing to full adult height

Professor Strang's Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available [here](/courses/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/).

Subtitles are provided through the generous assistance of Jimmy Ren.
