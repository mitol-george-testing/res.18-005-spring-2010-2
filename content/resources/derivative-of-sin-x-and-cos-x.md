The two key functions of oscillation have specially neat derivatives: The slope of sin x is cos x !    And the slope of cos x is - sin x.  
  
These come from one crucial fact:   (sin x) / x approaches 1 at x = 0. This checks that the slope of sin x is cos 0 = 1  at the all-important point x = 0.  
  
Professor Strang connects sine and cosine to moving around a circle,  
or up and down for a spring, or in and out for your lungs.

Professor Strang's Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available [here](/courses/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/).
