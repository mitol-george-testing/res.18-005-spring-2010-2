The slope of a function y(x) is the slope of its TANGENT LINE  
Close to x=a, the line with slope y ' (a) gives a "linear" approximation  
  
  y(x) is close to y(a) + (x - a) times y ' (a)  
  
If you want to solve y(x) = 0, choose x so that y(a) + (x - a) y ' (a) = 0  
This is a really fast way to get close to the exact solution to  y(x) = 0 :  
  
  "Newton's Method"      x = a - y(a)/y '(a)          SEE THE EXAMPLES
