These equations have 2nd derivatives because acceleration is in Newton's Law F = ma  
The key model equation is (second derivative) y ' ' = MINUS y or y ' ' =  MINUS a^2 y  
  
There are two solutions since the equation is second order.  They are SINE and COSINE  
y =  sin (at)  and y = cos (at)    Two derivatives bring back sine and cosine with minus a^2  
  
The next step allows damping (first derivative)  as in my ' ' +  dy ' + ky = 0   How to solve?  
Just try y = e^at   !!  You find that   ma^2 + da + k = 0   Two a's give two solutions: good
