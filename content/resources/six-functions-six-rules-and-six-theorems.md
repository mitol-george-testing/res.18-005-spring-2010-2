This lecture compresses all the others into one fast video for review of derivatives.  
  
Five of the 6 functions are old, the new one is a STEP function.  Slope = DELTA function.  
The 6 rules cover f + g, f times g, f divided by g, chains f(g(x)), inverse of f, and then L'HOPITAL for 0/0  
  
The 6 theorems include the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for INTEGRAL OF DERIVATIVE OF f(x)   
Function 1 is f(x)   Function 2 is its slope (rate of change)   Add up those changes to recover f(x)  !!  
  
The MEAN VALUE THEOREM says that if your average speed is 70,  then instant speed is 70 at least once  
The BINOMIAL THEOREM tells you the series that adds up to the pth power f(x) = (1 + x)^p
