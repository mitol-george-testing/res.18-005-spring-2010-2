For the usual y = f(x), the input is x and the output is y.  
For the INVERSE function x = f^-1(y), the input is y and the output is x.  
  
If y equals x cubed, then x is the cube root of y : that is the inverse.  
  
If y is the great function e^x, then x is the NATURAL LOGARITHM ln y.  
  
Start at y, go to x = ln y, then back to y = e^(ln y).  
So the LOGARITHM is the EXPONENT that produces y.    
The logarithm of y = e^5 is ln y = 5.    Logarithms grow very slowly.......
