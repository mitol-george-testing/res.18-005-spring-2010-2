The key model for growth (or decay when c < 0) is  dy/dt = c y(t)  
The next model allows a steady source (constant s in dy/dt = cy + s )  
The solutions include an exponential e^ct  (because its derivative brings down c)  
So growth forever if c is positive and decay if c is negative  
A neat model for the population P(t) adds in minus sP^2  (so P won't grow forever)  
This is nonlinear but luckily the equation for y = 1/P is linear and we solve it  
  
Population P follows an "S-curve" reaching a number like 10 or 11 billion (???)  
Great lecture but Professor Strang should have written e^-ct in the last formula
